shortDescription: "In this project, Alex identified sources of pollution in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca and Iasi, by looking at industrial emissions, traffic patterns, and waste disposal methods to understand their contributions to pollution levels."

For this project, Alex selected three major cities from different regions of the country: Cluj-Napoca with 320,000 inhabitants, Iasi with 290,000 inhabitants, and Bucharest, the capital, with a population of 2.2 million. For context, Alex chose Iasi and Bucharest because of the high air pollution levels that had led Brussels to take legal action against Romania. In addition, Alex chose Cluj-Napoca as one of the three locations due to its rapid growth, particularly in the IT and real estate sectors.

Utilizing two private sensor networks, <a href="https://www.stropdeaer.ro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stropdeaer</a> (Alexâ€™s own sensor network) and uradmonitor, Alex processed approximately 2,633,025 measurements collected throughout 2023 from nine sensors in Iasi, sixteen in Cluj-Napoca, and ten in Bucharest. The sensors employed in this research hold laboratory certifications for accuracy and performance from AQMD AQ-SPEC. Based on average measurements and location data, Alex identified and isolated the primary sources of pollutants, which included heavy traffic, construction sites, and local heating sources.

By integrating data from fixed sensors with mobile and portable units, Alex successfully analyzed airflow patterns within the selected large cities and pinpointed the main localized sources affecting air quality. This analysis allowed for the identification and isolation of specific pollution patterns: heavy traffic and construction activity in Cluj-Napoca, industrial emissions in Iasi, and waste disposal and burning practices in Bucharest.
