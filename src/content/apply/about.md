This annual program supports ten emerging air quality leaders in low- and middle-income countries in developing skills to fight air inequality — the unequal access to clean air. Over nine months, Ambassadors are provided with interdisciplinary training (with a focus on using data), leadership development, and a supportive professional community to hone skills and expertise in the air quality field. Beyond the program, there are extended opportunities to collaborate and participate in OpenAQ activities.

OpenAQ aggregates and harmonizes open air quality data from across the globe onto a free open-source data platform so that anyone concerned about air quality has unfettered access to the data they need to analyze, communicate and advocate for clean air. OpenAQ facilitates collaboration across sectors and geographies so that those working with air quality data learn from each other.

## As an OpenAQ Community Ambassador, you will:

- Grow leadership and technical skills to advance your work to fight air inequality
- Work on a project that uses data to tackle an air quality issue in your community
- Be provided with one to two air sensors to monitor air quality
- Connect with OpenAQ and diverse professional mentors within OpenAQ’s global network
- Serve as a key liaison between your community and OpenAQ and host one or more OpenAQ activities in your local community and/or region
- Provide key perspectives to OpenAQ that help the organization increase its contributions to your and other communities
- Be featured on the OpenAQ website and social media as an OpenAQ Community Ambassador
- Learn about diverse opportunities such as related workshops, trainings, and conferences (with potential support from OpenAQ in reviewing your application or providing a letter of support)
- Receive a $2,000 USD stipend to participate in the program
