Farah Kazi is a Biotechnologist and a former Data Visualiser. After graduating from Dr. D.Y. Patil University, Navi Mumbai, she pursued her post-graduate diploma in Social Communications Media at SCM Sophia College, University of Mumbai. Her interest in air pollution stems from when she began working at IndiaSpend, where she spent a significant part of her time analysing and visualising air quality data. She currently works at Waatavaran, where she undertakes air quality monitoring studies and builds communication strategies to initiate both public dialogue and to advance reforms in policies. Apart from fixating on numbers and grammar, she reads books and enjoys cooking.
