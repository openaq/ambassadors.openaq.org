Mozambique faces significant air pollution challenges that threaten both public health and environmental sustainability. In urban areas, unregulated industrial activity, vehicular emissions, and urbanization contribute to rising levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants. For example, high levels of PM2.5 in Maputo, the capital, are largely attributed to vehicular emissions and industrial expansion (WHO, 2021). Meanwhile, in rural areas, many households rely on biomass fuels, such as wood and charcoal, for cooking, resulting in high levels of indoor air pollution. The reliance on biomass fuels contributes to health problems such as respiratory diseases and is a leading cause of premature death in rural populations (WHO, 2021). This combination has created a silent crisis, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, including women, children, and the elderly (UNEP, 2020).

Moreover, air pollution in Mozambique is not always a primary concern in policy discussions. Other pressing challenges, such as economic instability, poverty, and access to healthcare, dominate political agendas. Additionally, the absence of large-scale, catastrophic air quality events—like the severe smog crises seen in some other countries—means that the severity of air pollution often goes unrecognized. However, despite its invisibility, research indicates that air pollution contributes to a variety of health problems, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and premature death. These effects often go underreported and are exacerbated by a lack of awareness and data.

The "Clean Air Mozambique: Community-Led Air Quality Monitoring and Advocacy" project addresses this urgent issue by empowering communities to monitor air quality, understand its impact on their health, and advocate for policies that promote cleaner air. By combining education, technology, and community engagement, this initiative aims to create a grassroots movement capable of driving meaningful change. With continued community engagement even after António has graduated from the Community Ambassador program, technical support, and stakeholder collaboration, the project continues to expand sensor coverage, enhance a homegrown air quality data platform (“SGG Explorer”), and increase advocacy efforts through targeted campaigns. António expects these activities to have a lasting impact on public health and environmental sustainability in Mozambique, contributing to a cleaner and healthier future for the country’s communities.
