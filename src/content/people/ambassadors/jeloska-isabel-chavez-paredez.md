Jeloska Chavez is a Bolivian software developer building the technical infrastructure for La Paz's first open air quality monitoring system. As technical lead for Universidad Mayor de San Andrés-Laboratorio de Física de la Atmósfera (UMSA-LFA)'s low-cost sensor network, she designs the data pipelines, quality controls, and public dashboards making real-time PM data accessible at 3,600 meters. From volunteer researcher to technical lead, she's proving that open, quality-controlled air quality monitoring is achievable in high-altitude, resource-limited environments.
