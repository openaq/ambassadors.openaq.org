Central Asia is becoming a global air pollution hotspot, with four of its five major cities frequently in the world rankings of top countries with the worst air quality, partly because of its rapid urbanization accompanied by aging infrastructure. Despite Central Asia becoming an air pollution hotspot, the effects of air pollution are largely understudied. Shortage and inconsistency in data and region-specific analysis have hindered the development of effective interventions and awareness campaigns.

In this project, Ravkat aimed to assess the short-term health effects of air pollution in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and translated these findings into practical insights for the population. He developed an approach to estimate the effect of air pollution on various diagnoses, and analyze age and gender differences of such effects using publicly available data. By identifying the groups most affected by air pollution and the contexts that exacerbate exposure, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge in public health and environmental science, specifically for the Central Asian context. This project integrates data analysis with creative communication approaches to close the gap between research outcomes and public awareness. In this project, Ravkat combined an analytical approach, including data collection, integration, and statistical modelling, and deployed personal and stationary air sensors, and explored the implications of his study results, focusing on policy recommendations and practical measures to reduce air pollution exposure.
