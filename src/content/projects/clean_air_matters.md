Air pollution is a daily reality for many in Cameroon, yet it remains largely unmeasured and inadequately addressed at the policy level. According to <a href="https://www.unep.org/interactives/air-pollution-note" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNEP</a>, fine particulate pollution caused approximately 5,900 deaths in the country in 2021. The cities of Douala and Yaoundé are particularly affected due to rapid urbanization and demographic growth driven by rural-to-urban migration. This expansion has led to severe traffic congestion, the proliferation of motorbike taxis, and the widespread use of imported vehicles with emissions that often fail to meet air quality standards. Industrial activities and inefficient waste management further exacerbate air pollution. Beyond major urban centers, peripheral cities and rural areas also face significant air pollution challenges. Dust and the reliance on polluting fuels for cooking expose populations to severe health risks linked to poor air quality.

This project focused on field data collection with spice grinders in the markets and supporting environmental clubs. As a continuation of this initiative, Melisa’s organization <a href="https://elheas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(ELHEAS)</a> took over the expansion of the subject population and enhanced the significance of the collected data. An air sensor in a local establishment was also completed and expected to enrich the air quality data in the area.

Beyond data collection, Melissa’s conviction about the urgent need for awareness and the popularization of air quality monitoring policies has significantly strengthened. For Melissa, it is crucial that Cameroonians understand the stakes of the air they breathe, as well as the direct impact this air quality has on their health and life expectancy. This awareness is also what led Melissa to launch her podcast, **_Voice of The Air: Decoding the Invisible with Air Quality Stories_**, to give a voice to all stakeholders and inform the general public about the crucial issues related to air quality.
