Public concern about air quality in Bulgaria has been growing, with many citizens expressing anxiety over pollution levels in their communities and the associated health impacts. Public perception plays a vital role in shaping policy responses and public health initiatives. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups in Bulgaria have been pivotal in raising awareness and advocating for stricter air quality regulations and enforcement. As a medical doctor and healthcare professional, Kostadin is deeply concerned and engaged in solving air quality issues in Plovdiv and is an active member of <a href="https://air4health.eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Air4Health</a>, an organization comprised of medical professionals and public health experts conducting public awareness campaigns, research, policy advocacy and educational events aimed at reducing the health burden of air pollution.

In this project, Kostadin presented two case studies conducted in Bulgaria that examined the immediate health and economic impacts of air pollution and societal attitudes toward the issue. The first case study investigated changes in hospital admissions for acute or exacerbated chronic respiratory diseases in Plovdiv, Bulgaria as a result of an acute air pollution episode on August 2nd, 2024. The second case study explored public perceptions of air pollution health risks in the industrial city of Ruse, Bulgaria where the air pollution levels are among the highest in the country.
