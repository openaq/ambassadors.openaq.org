## Applications are open for the 2026 OpenAQ Community Ambassador Program!

Applications are open for the 2026 OpenAQ Community Ambassador Program!
This annual program, supports ten emerging air quality leaders in low-
and middle-income countries in developing skills to fight air
inequality—the unequal access to clean air. Over ten months, Ambassadors
are provided with interdisciplinary training (with a focus on using
data), leadership development, and a supportive professional community
to hone skills and expertise in the air quality field. There are also
extended opportunities to collaborate and participate in OpenAQ
activities beyond the program.

OpenAQ aggregates and harmonizes open air quality data from across the
globe onto a free open-source data platform so that anyone concerned
about air quality has unfettered access to the data they need to
analyze, communicate and advocate for clean air. We work to facilitate
collaboration across sectors and geographies so that those working with
air quality data learn from each other.
